/*
 * # IP buckets and provisioning
 *
 * "for all things that have a function or activity, the good and the well is
 * thought to reside in the function" - Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics
 *
 * ## bucket structure
 *
 * There is one IP bucket per network, named napi_ips_<network UUID>, as per
 * bucketName() below. For older networks, the key is in .ip, which is the
 * integer representation of the IP address. Newer networks store it in .ipaddr,
 * which uses the Postgres INET type. These are both unique keys. The bucket is
 * created with certain keys pre-populated. A diagram of these keys sorted in
 * ascending order looks like this:
 *
 *   +--------------------------------------------------------+
 *   |   | GW |     | PS |                | PE |         | BR |
 *   +--------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 *   * GW: the gateway IP for that subnet - if the subnet has a gateway,
 *     this record will be reserved on creation.
 *   * BR: the broadcast address for that subnet - always reserved, since
 *     this isn't a usable IP.
 *   * PS: A placeholder record for (provision_start_ip - 1)
 *   * PE: A placeholder record for (provision_end_ip + 1)
 *
 * How PS and PE are used is explained in the "How nextGapIPsOnNetwork() works"
 * section below.
 *
 *
 * ## IP provisioning process
 *
 * The two guiding properties of the IP provision process are:
 *
 * 1) It should have a deterministic order, from lowest IP in the subnet
 *    to highest (if possible).  This makes it easy to test, easy for
 *    operators to guess what the subnet usage will look like, and makes gap
 *    detection much easier (explained in the "How nextGapIPsOnNetwork() works"
 *    section below).
 *
 * 2) For IP records that are freed (eg: a record that was provisioned, but
 *    is no longer needed and returned to the pool), we should pick the
 *    one freed the longest time ago.  This is mostly to prevent a lot of
 *    churn in ARP tables on switches - if we were to pick the most recently
 *    used one, repeated provisioning and deprovisioning of an IP would cause
 *    a lot of updates to the ARP records for that IP.
 *
 *
 * Those two properties lead to a provisioning process as follows:
 *
 * 1) Try to find a free IP that has never been used before (this is
 *    nextGapIPsOnNetwork() below).
 *
 * 2) If there are no never-used IPs, return the one that was freed the
 *    longest time ago (this is nextFreedIPsonNetwork() below).
 *
 * 3) If there are no freed IPs left, the subnet is full.
 *
 * Note that if we are requesting a specific IP, the provisioning process
 * is skipped - we just try to add the IP record, or update it with the
 * new owner if it does not exist.  If the record is already taken, this
 * process returns an error.
 *
 *
 * ## How nextGapIPsOnNetwork() works
 *
 * nextGapIPsOnNetwork() abuses the fact that moray is implemented on top of
 * Postgres, and that you can run arbitrary SQL against it using .sql().
 *
 * nextGapIPsOnNetwork() uses Postgres' lead() window function to search for
 * gaps in the values of the ip column for the napi_ips_<uuid> bucket for a
 * network.  For example, say that you have the following records in the
 * PG table for that bucket (these are not real IP numbers, and what's in
 * the _key and _value columns is not important):
 *
 *   | ip | _key | _value |
 *   +----+------+--------+
 *   | 3  | ...  | ...    |
 *   | 4  | ...  | ...    |
 *   | 5  | ...  | ...    |  \  first
 *   | 9  | ...  | ...    |  /   gap
 *   | 10 | ...  | ...    |  \  second
 *   | 14 | ...  | ...    |  /   gap
 *
 * lead() will find 2 gaps here (values for ip that don't yet exist in the
 * table).  It will return a gap_start value of 6 for the first gap, and 11
 * for the second.
 *
 * nextGapIPsOnNetwork() tries up to 10 times to find a new gap_start, and then
 * tries to do a put of that record to moray with a null _etag value.  This
 * will cause moray to return an error if that record is already present.
 * This is meant to handle multiple NAPIs writing to the same record at the
 * same time.
 *
 * The placeholder records PS and PE are put on either side of the provision
 * range:
 *
 *   * PS = provision_start_ip - 1
 *   * PE = provision_end_ip + 1
 *
 * PG's gap detection requires these records in order to find gaps, but it
 * will only return values for gap_start that aren't in the table yet.  If
 * provision_start_ip and provision_end_ip were present instead, those records
 * would never be picked as gap_start, and would therefore be provisioned last
 * (see the next section).
 *
 *
 * ## How nextFreedIPsonNetwork() works
 *
 * First off, when an IP is deprovisioned, deleteIP() does not remove the
 * record from moray.  It just replaces the record with a value that has
 * reserved: false, and no other values.  This ensures that
 * nextGapIPsOnNetwork() can still continue to find gaps in the IP range
 * efficiently.
 *
 * Therefore, to find freed records, all we need to do is find records in
 * moray that have reserved=false and no belongs_to_uuid.  Sorting by
 * modification time takes care of using the records that were freed the
 * longest time ago.
 *
 * As with nextGapIPsOnNetwork(), we retrieve up to 10 records, trying a put on
 * each in order with _etag set, to handle multiple NAPIs trying to claim
 * the same record.
 *
 *
 * ## IP record life cycle
 *
 * The Boss said it best:
 *
 * "Everything dies, baby, that's a fact.  But maybe everything that dies
 * someday comes back" - Bruce Springsteen, Atlantic City
 *
 * An IP address in NAPI moves between the various states in the following
 * diagram. Note that it never returns to the "no record in moray" state.
 * The IP moves through the addIP() and updateIP() paths when we are
 * requesting a specific IP.  It moves through the nextGapIPsOnNetwork() and
 * nextFreedIPsonNetwork() paths when we don't care about which IP a VM gets -
 * we just want to provision an IP on the network.
